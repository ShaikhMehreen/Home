								The book was published in 1948 and follows Oba Yozo and his descent into madness. 
								The book is able to portray the sense of lonliness and confusion Oba feels as he 
								is unable to show his true nature to most people, and believes he is a man disqualified
								as a human being.

					<h1>Aside from novels, I love to read mangas!</h1>
					<p>Mangas are a wide variety of comic books and graphic novels 
						produced and published in Japan. Unlike western comic books,
						mangas are printed in only black and white (aside from some extra pages).
						Manga is read from right-to-left rather than how we usually read left-to-right.
						Most manga authors draw each panel physically rather than digitally. I'm always 
						suprised by how amazing the art looks in different mangas, all with unique styles.
						I enjoy reading mangas because there is a wide variety of genres, unique plots, and lovable characters. 
						<br><br>Here are some of my favourite manga panels! (You can hover over each image to see the manga name)

						<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
						<p>The hit series by Hajime Isayama is a very detailed and intruiging read. The story 
							focuses on the struggle of surviving and understanding how there are always two sides to a 
							story. The plot is very well written, along with many plot twists that are foreshadowed from 
							the very beginning. The manga has a bitter-sweet ending bringing the story to a complete end.

						<h3>The Promised Neverland</h3>
						<p>The Promised Neverland is a unique story with plot twists I didn't expect.
							The story follows three children Emma, Norman, and Ray who live alongside other orphans.
							One day they learn the orphanage is really a farm where the children are raised and given
							to demons to be eaten.The three work out a plan to escape with the rest of the children.
							The story has a bitter-sweet ending, that I enjoyed.

						<h3>Uzumaki</h3>
						<p>Uzumaki is one of Junji Ito's most popular mangas. The story follows Kirie and Shuichi 
							who live in a strange town where bizarre events occur. Uzumaki is a horror manga with 
							amazing art. It leaves you questioning life, and fearing what's in the dark. I believe
							the ending is satisfying, showing what the result of hardwork can be sometimes.

							Thorfinn is a young boy who holds a grudge against a powerful viking who killed a loved one. Thorfinn

							meets different people and grows from his experience. I enjoy this manga because it has heavy themes and explains
							deep morals throughout the show.
