								<h3>Biryani</h3>
								<p> Biryani is a very popular food in Pakistan where my parents were born.
									It consists of rice, spices, and meat if you want. I ate a lot of biryani when I visted 
									Pakistan in 2019. I was bale to meet with my cousins, uncles, and aunts who I hadn't seen in 
									years. I went shopping and saw many sights while travelling. The best part of 
									the trip was the food though, and I would love to try it again someday!

								<h3>Baking</h3>
								<p>I love to bake whenever I have free time. Though I am not very good at it, I always try my 
									best, and have fun in the process. My favourite desert is cheesecake, and I like to make that a lot.
									I am a sugar-addict, and will munch on anything that is sweet enough! I love cakes, muffins, cookies 
									and so much more. I would love to be able to bake delicious apple pies, and will continue to work
									hard to achieve this goal!

							<h3>Purple</h3>
							<p> Purple is my favourite color. I was always been obsessed with purple as a child, buying purple clothes, purple toys,
								and so much more purple. Even now, I love purple because it feels very royal and special. I especially
								like the shade that is in the picture above the best!

							<h3>Ellesmere Statton</h3>
							<p> I've attended Ellesmere Statton since kindergarden up to grade 8. I met
								a lot of friends, and great teachers. Unfortunately I wasn't able to properly say goodbyes 
								to friends or teachers because of COVID-19. All certificates were sent through mail and that
								was our graduation. If I ever get the chance, I would love to visit the school again, and
								chat with my old teachers.

							<h3>Ultimate Frisbee</h3>
							<p> I began playing Ultimate in grade 4, and fell in love with the sport. I've been to multiple 
								tournaments with my team, and once we even got to the quarter-finals! I wasn't able to play the sport 
								recently because of COVID restrictions, but I'm hoping I can play at the school with new friends!
								Ultimate is an exhausting sport to play, and you need to be in good shape and have good stamina in order to
								play properly.

							<!--Inputting image of anime and explaining why I like it-->
							<img src="images/anime.jpg" alt="Anime">
							<h3>Anime</h3>
							<p>I really love to watch anime whenever I have free time, because it is a fun adventure I get to take 
								with the characters. I like to watch animes that have a well-written plot and overall leave an impact on 
								me. I am currently watching 'Kaguya-Sama: Love is War', and plan on catching up with 'To Your Eternity'.
								I have a small manga collection (mostly filled with Attack on Titan), and plan on buying more to 
								expand my collection.

								[I have a section dedicated to my favourite animes, you can use the navigation menu to check that out!]

							<h3>Volleyball</h3>
							<p> I began playingvolleyball in grade 6, when my firends first passed me the ball. It took a while to 
								get used to, but eventually I was able to get the hang of it. I really enjoy playing volleyball because it requires teamwork,
								and it requires you to use your brain. I prefer bumping over volleying, and under-hand serves are my 
								way to go! I'd love to play volleyball again soon with my friends!

							<!--Talking about how covid has impacted my life-->
							<h3>How has Covid impacted my life</h3>
							<p> If you told me there would be a long pandemic and a dangerous virus was going around in 2019, I would
								have called you crazy. Unfortunately that is exactly the situation we are all in right now. Covid harmed my life in 
								many ways, and I really hope things are able to get back to normal soon. Firstly, I lost touch with a lot of friends during the
								pandemic. Despite this though, I got to know other people better and was able to strengthen our friendship. 
								I also wasn't able to meet a lot of new people at Victoria Park. I would've loved to meet many different people and make
								new friends, but I was only in-person for the first quad. The only thing that kept me from being bored during quarantine was
								anime and mangas. I had been watching anime before the pandemic, but I was able to watch more longer shows during quarantine,
								as there was no school to worry about. My sleep schedule was destroyed over the quarantine, and now I can't fall asleep before 12 am.
								There was also a lot of news and killings during the time, and opening social media during the time felt sickening. Every other post would be about 
								covid or killings, and I think that impacted me a lot. Overall, the pandemic was not a positive part of my live, and hopefully I 
								am able to call it a -closed- chapter of my life soon!
