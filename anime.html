				<!--The Introductions about anime and why I like it-->
				<section class="anime">
					<p>Anime is hand-drawn and computer animation orginating from Japan. In Japan, anime 
					describes all animated works, regardless of styles or origin.<br></p>
					<hr>
					<p>Anime is an art I believe everyone should experience at least once. I began watching a few years ago, and 
						was instantly drawn in by the unique plot and characters it has to offer. Whenever I have free time, I 
						like to start a new series, or continue watching the one I am currently watching. Anime can come in 
						many different genres, and I personally prefer action, pyschology, and slice of life. These are all 
						completely different, but I usually watch any anime that allows me to think and in general have fun.
				
					<br>
					<br>
						Here are some of my favourite animes that I would recommend checking out! I've also placed the first theme song 
						from all the shows I listed. They're in japanese, but I believe they are very fun to listen to!
					</p>

							<!--Fullmetal Alchemist-->
							<h3>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h3>
							<p> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an anime that was released in 2009, 
								and is widely considered to be one of the greatest anime of all time. 
								The story follows two alchemist brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric who 
								want to find a way to restore their bodies after attempting to
								bring their mother back from the dead. The process fails,
								and as a punishment for using this forbidden form of alchemy, Edward loses his 
								left leg and right arm, while Alphone loses his entire body. As they travel to 
								find the special stone that will allow them to get their body back, they discover 
								many secrets and uncover the truth behind their country, and that everyone's lives
								are in danger. <br>
								Everything about this show is amazing, and I love how the ending was satisfying and 
								everything came to a close. The soundtrack from this show is one of my favourite, 
								every opening and ending suiting the arc the story is in. I would highly recommend if 
								you want to get into anime but don't know where to start, or if you want a fun and
								intruiging show to watch!

							<!--Attack on Titan-->
							<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
							<p> Attack on Titan is one of my favourite animes because of the detailed plot.
								The plot centers on a civilization inside three walls, the last location 
								where humans still live. Over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven 
								to the brink of extinction after the emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, 
								who attack and eat humans on sight. Eren swears revenge on the Titans after witnessing
								his mother's death. Him and his childhood friends Mikasa, and Armin join an elite
								group of soldiers who fight against the Titans.<br>
								I really enjoy this show because it is very well written, and the plot twists are
								all foreshadowed from the very beginning. There is a lot of gore within the show, 
								and it might be upsetting to some veiwers. The large scale massacres are what make 
								Attack on Titan so unique, in the fact that the creator does not hesitate to get rid
								of any character. I would definetly recommend watching!

							<!--Neon Genesis Evangelion-->
							<h3>Neon Genesis Evangelion</h3>
							<p> Neon Genesis Evangelion follows the story of 14 year old Shinji Ikari who is summoned
								by the father who abandonned him as a child. He discovers that he is a match for the Evangelion,
								a giant robot which is used to fight monsters. Shinji is faced with many hard decisions, and often
								faces severe consequences for choosing the wrong choice. There are lots of upsetting scenes
								within the show, but it all leads up to the movie, where Shinji must make a decision with the fate
								of humanity in his hands. Evangelion was first released in 1995, and quickly became a hit in both 
								Japan and in western media. It also became a very controversial show because of how cryptic the ending was, 
								and demanded the ending be remade. Now, there are 4 rebuild movies, which work as an alternative universe.<br>
								Neon Genesis Evangelion is an absolute masterpiece is you are able to understand the 
								themes and messages behind it. The first time I watched the show, I wasn't able to understand 
								the final movie, but rewatching allowed me to truely understand what the creator is trying to
								say. I also really enjoy the theme song "A Cruel Angel's Thesis" as well as all the other soundtrack 
								in both the show and the movie. I would definetly recommend giving a watch, though not a lot of people
								enjoy the show during their first watch like I did.

							<!--Jojo's Bizarre Adventures-->
							<h3>Jojo's Bizarre Adventures</h3>
							<p> Jojo's Bizarre Adventures as the name implies, is an anime full of bizarre events
								and adventures. The story is about the Joestar family, who are possessed with intese 
								psychic strength, and the adventures they face throughout their lives. There are currently 5 parts
								animated, and the sixth in production. The story is full of comedy and tragedies, along with shocking 
								plot twists.<br>
								I really enjoy this show because it is fun and exciting. All the parts had a great ending, and
								I was curious to see how the story would progress from there. I would recommend to anyone 
								who is looking for something bizarre and fun to start!

							<!--Dr.Stone-->
							<h3>Dr.Stone</h3>
							<p>A mysteroius green light suddenly engulfs Earth, and humanity is left petrified, frozen in stone.
								Thousands of years later, Senku Ishigami awakens from the stone only to find he is the only human
								who came out of the stone. He sees that humanity and all of it's inventions have been overtaken by nature.
								As he tries to revive more people, he accidentally revives Tsukasa, the strongest teenager
								on Earth. He believes only the strong should be allowed to live in this stone world, while Senku wants to 
								revive everyone on Earth and return it to a civilized population. As they both work against each other
								it is a battle of brains vs brawns! <br>
								I really enjoy Dr.Stone because it revolves around science, and using the mind. Senku is an interesting character,
								and I am interested in seeing how he can accomplish his goal of reviving humanity. Dr.Stone is 
								a fun comedy that I would highly recommend!
